* We <3 Ruby
** Ruby is made for programmer's happiness
** But Ruby is slow
** Really? Let's measure it

* Benchmark module
* GC 
* Optimization

** Algorithms
*** They matter!
** Data structures
*** Set vs Array
*** Struct vs Hash
** More than one way of doing things
*** String interploation vs addition vs append
** Memoization
*** use of ||=
*** use of constants
** Database
*** Raw SQL
*** ActiveRecord::Transaction in Rails
*** Reduce un-necessary access to DB
*** find_each instead of loading all records
** GC optimization

* Remember
   
   "We should forget about small efficiencies, 
   say about 97% of the time: 
   premature optimization is the root of all evil"
   -- Donald Knuth
