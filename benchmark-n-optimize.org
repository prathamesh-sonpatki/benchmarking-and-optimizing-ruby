* We <3 Ruby
** Ruby is made for programmer's happiness
** But Ruby is slow
** Really? Let's measure it

* Benchmark module
* Garbage Collector
** mark-n-sweep, non-generational
** ObjectSpace, GC modules
* Optimization
** Algorithms
*** They matter!
** Data structures
*** Eg. Set vs Array
** More than one way of doing things
*** String interploation vs addition vs concatenation
** Database
*** Raw SQL
*** ActiveRecord::Transaction in Rails
*** Reduce un-necessary access to DB
*** find_each instead of loading all records
* Remember

   "We should forget about small efficiencies,
   say about 97% of the time:
   premature optimization is the root of all evil"
   -- Donald Knuth
